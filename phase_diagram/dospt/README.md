To run these scripts you first need to have a working [DoSPT](dospt.org)
installation. On the Virtual Machine set up for the Adv. Stat. Phys.
students, just do "module load dospt" before executing the bash script.
Once a DoSPT installation is available through the "DoSPT" command, make
sure that you have already run the "run_TP.sh" command one directory above,
so that the "results_$Np/" directory exists. If you have modified the list
of temperatures and or pressures, make sure to fix the command here
accordingly.
